# Introduction

Digital reminders are best when they are placed tidily in areas we look at frequently. Think, what *is* the digital space we look at the most? Well, what else but tabs!

# How to Use

Tab Markers can't get much simplier. Just open up the website, type the reminder in the textbox near the middle of the page and press "Submit" (or hit "Enter" on your keyboard) and voila! The reminder pops up on the title of the tab.

#Usages
Tab Markers can be used alongside Chrome's neat tab group feature for school assignments
